 * Every magical creature in the kingdom is given a name. The name directly dictates its power level, a mystical property
 * informing every wizard how powerful the creature is. The longer the creature's name the more powerful it is.

 * If within its name the following words are present each 9000 for each of these words to its power level:
 * - Overpowered
 * - Mythical
 * - Sexy
 *
 * For any of these words add 50 points:
 * - Unicorn
 * - Giraffe
 * - Griffon
 * - Racoon
 *
 * - Also for the first word add 1, for the second 2 and so forth
